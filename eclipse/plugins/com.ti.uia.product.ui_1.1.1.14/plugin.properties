example_0_title = evm6472: MessageQ (single image for all cores) with UIA
example_0_description = The message example shows how to use MessageQ on EVM6472 and UIA. It is a single-image example that must be loaded on all cores.\n\nA message is sent from core 0 to core 1 to core 2...back to core 0. The UIABenchmark_start and stop is used on core 0 to determine the duration of a round trip.\n\nThe Log data is obtained via Ethernet.

example_1_title = Stairstep JTAG StopMode
example_1_description = The stairstep example runs continusously and periodically generates log events. Different threads (Hwi, Swi, Task) run to present a CPU load to the system.\n\nThe Log data is obtained when the target is halted.\n\nThe sizes of the loggers in LoggingSetup might need to be decreased if your target does not have enough memory.

example_2_title = Stairstep Ethernet
example_2_description = The stairstep example runs continuously and periodically generates log events. Different threads (Hwi, Swi, Task) run to present a CPU load to the system.\n\nLog data is obtained via Ethernet.\n\nThe sizes of the loggers in LoggingSetup might need to be decreased if your target does not have enough memory.\n\nThis example, as is, only works for the EVM6472 board. Refer to the bottom of the .cfg file on how to use on a different board.

example_3_title = Stairstep JTAG RunMode
example_3_description = The stairstep example runs continusously and periodically generates log events. Different threads (Hwi, Swi, Task) run to present a CPU load to the system.\n\nThe Log data is obtained by reading the running target (only works on C64X+ and C66 CPUs).\n\nThe sizes of the loggers in LoggingSetup might need to be decreased if your target does not have enough memory.

example_4_title = Stairstep ProbePoint
example_4_description = The stairstep example runs continusously and periodically generates log events. Different threads (Hwi, Swi, Task) run to present a CPU load to the system.\n\nThe Log data is obtained by temporarily stopping the target when the Log call is made.\n\nThe sizes of the loggers in LoggingSetup might need to be decreased if your target does not have enough memory.\n\nTo build this example, the XDC version must be 3.22 (or later) or the RTSC Build-Profile must be "release" or "debug" (not "whole_program").

example_5_title = LoggerStreamer Example
example_5_description = Example showing the usage of LoggerStreamer and LogUC.h

example_6_title = Stairstep Simulator
example_6_description = The stairstep example runs continusously and periodically generates log events. Different threads (Hwi, Swi, Task) run to present a CPU load to the system.\n\nThe Log data is obtained by temporarily stopping the target when the Log call is made.\n\nThe sizes of the loggers in LoggingSetup might need to be decreased if your target does not have enough memory\n\nTo build this example, the XDC version must be 3.22 (or later) or the RTSC Build-Profile must be "release" or "debug" (not "whole_program").

example_7_title = evmti816x: SimpleTask w/ LoggerCircBuf for the DSP
example_7_description = This DSP example uses LoggerCircBuf to log benchmark events. The events are routed through the ServiceMgr on Linux.\n\nThe program benchmarks the duration to run an "algorithm"\n\nRefer to the Getting Started Guide for a more detailed description.

example_8_title = evmti816x: SimpleTask w/ LoggerSM for the DSP
example_8_description = This DSP example uses LoggerSM to log benchmark events. The events can be displayed to the Linux console or written to a binary file.\n\nThe program benchmarks the duration to run an "algorithm"\n\nRefer to the Getting Started Guide for a more detailed description.

example_9_title = evmti816x: SimpleTask w/ LoggerCircBuf for the video M3
example_9_description = This Video M3 example uses LoggerCircBuf to log benchmark events. The events are routed through the ServiceMgr on Linux.\n\nThe program benchmarks the duration to run an "algorithm"\n\nRefer to the Getting Started Guide for a more detailed description.

example_10_title = evmti816x: SimpleTask w/ LoggerCircBuf for the vpss M3
example_10_description = This VPSS M3 example uses LoggerCircBuf to log benchmark events. The events are routed through the ServiceMgr on Linux.\n\nThe program benchmarks the duration to run an "algorithm"\n\nRefer to the Getting Started Guide for a more detailed description.

example_11_title = evmti816x: SimpleTask w/ LoggerSM for the video M3
example_11_description = This Video M3 example uses LoggerSM to log benchmark events. The events can be displayed to the Linux console or written to a binary file.\n\nThe program benchmarks the duration to run an "algorithm"\n\nRefer to the Getting Started Guide for a more detailed description.

example_13_title = System Analyzer and UIA Tutorial 1: Logging events, benchmarking, controlling events.
example_13_description = This tutorial shows how to log errors, warnings and info events, benchmark code and control which events are logged. Refer to http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/McsaTutorial1 for more details.

example_14_title = System Analyzer and UIA Tutorial 2: Graphing events, using JTAG Run-Mode (C64X+ or C66X emulation target)
example_14_description = This tutorial shows how to log data that can be graphed and analyzed for min/max/average statistics.  Also demonstrates how to use LoggerCircBuf and JTAG Run-Mode to upload events while a target is running . Refer to http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/McsaTutorial2 for more details.
